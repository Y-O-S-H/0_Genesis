Mission statement and guidelines for how Y.O.S.H. should evolve

## Mission Statement
To provide a simple, logical presentation of information in as digestable a package that 'humanity' could provide that will enable personal, social, and communal growth.

## Y-O-S-H (YourOpenSourceHumanity)

1. Food (Sourcing food; easy diet/nutrition; eating habits; help.)

2. Security (Access to health/security/shelter/stability; confidence of current knowledge.)

3. Learning (Art/Education/Hobbies/Passion/Science/Skills/Learning how to give yourself more free time/Self Improvement.)

4. Economy (Learning how to effeciently utilize the flow of a resource from sourcing to consumption.)

5. Maintenance (The importance of ensuring the sustainability of your economic environment.)

6. Tribe (Learning how to coexist and benefit both yourself and your family, friends, pets, and close personal relationships; either by choice, environment, or biology.)

7. Village (Interacting effectively within your community; ability to interact/trade with strangers/others for the best economic result.)

8. Love_and_Sex (How to effectively understand yourself in relation to the concepts of sex and love, and how they apply to individuals and society.)

9. Luxury (You've reached your best! You really have earned it, enjoy it! Every human being deserves to bask in whatever glory they create.)

10. Forgiveness (Learning to truly accept yourself and others; understanding that it does not mean you or anyone else has to change. You just have to talk.)

## Huh? Are you saying you want to help EVERYONE? How? You sure as hell don't know 'me'!
That's true, I don't know you. I just know how to do 'human' my way, so... tell me how to do yours. I'm willing to learn your way. I believe it's achieveable because Y.O.S.H.'s goal is to present an easily understandable and logical framework that enables growth both personally and globally. But those are 'my' words, and the trouble with THAT is that a lot of people like to argue about words and sentences, or even the messenger.
Plain and simple: Being nice to each other makes everyone richer.
The followup question usually being, "Why would anyone do it? Must be sort of scam/cult/ego trip."
To which the obvious reply is to simply repeat the original answer. Being nice to each other makes everyone richer. It has nothing to do with religion, and it works regardless of your economic or political belief.

## Okay, cool. Even if you aren't completely full of shit, how could 'I' contribute?
Use Y.O.S.H. first. Prove it wrong, or right. Let 'us' do the work for you, and we really just need the questions. As much as WE are able to provide you, we will. Only if we provide you with a tangible benefit will anything be proven true. So, challenge us. If the system sounds too good to be true, throw it a curve ball. Stress test it. But, and this is the trade-off here, if you find that using Y.O.S.H. HAS helped your life, you have to be willing to make yourself happy first. Nobody else. Just you. And then tell you can talk about contributing. Because until we've helped you we truly haven't earned the right for you to listen.

## Dunno man, this still sounds weird. What about people that don't even care?
At Y.O.S.H. we ask you to be selfish first, and we will enable that any way we can. You don't have to care. This system has to work for ALL humanity, even those that want to be let alone.

And as for this sounding weird?

#### Reality
* The 45th President-elect of the United States of America - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump]

#### Fantasy
* That 'everyone' has actually evolved a lot faster than people thought. Anyone could teach anyone anything they knew in such a short period of time, but that sounds like it makes people 'not special'. The truth however is in our language. Most people talk in MEMES now, because they encapsulate for so many people a far more concise and emotive point that they want to express, without having to read a lot of books so they know fancy enough words. The amazing thing is the human brain is already capable of learning VERY complicated things very fast, and the older they get the SMARTER they are. It is perhaps the easiest theory to disprove, and yet 'you' are still reading this.

# CREDITS AND DEBITS

Without these special people, you wouldn't be reading Y.O.S.H.
When this organization cannot make good on its mission statement, we want the world to know that even we have dues to pay to those who have provided so much that we are indebted to them. If they are on this list, we owe them something. Work. Money. Coffee. Time. We will maintain this list so they know we will only allow us to forget our debts when they have repaid to our debtors satisfaction.

###Debits

* Urga (Money, and first pick of any seat feasible for them to take at any Y.O.S.H. negotiating table.)
* Chef (Money, and first pick of any seat feasible for them to take at any Y.O.S.H. negotiating table.)

###Credits

The Y.O.S.H. team also wishes to acknowledge those (who are allowing us to do so) who have provided tangible help so far. This list isn't any less important, it's just not something we have to give our accountants or lawyers. We keep THIS list because we like being given a shoutout if we do something good, so it only makes sense for us to do the same for those who have truly helped.
